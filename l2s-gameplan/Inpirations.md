## Portal

Obviously taking a lot from portal. I love the way puzzles are designed around the mechanics and improve on them, with the story expanding with each new level. It makes the game feel like a real and full story, not just a succession of non-connected levels

## Split fiction

I haven’t actually played this one, and it’s more of a vibe thing. I like the way the screen is split and you alternate between worlds, and it’s technically and artistically impressing.
