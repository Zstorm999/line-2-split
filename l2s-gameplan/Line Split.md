I worked on **Line \ Split** during the 2025 BDJ ESIEA Jam. The theme was **Duality**. 

I created this game with the following links to the theme:
- 2 worlds (red and blue) that you can switch to to solve the maze
- duality of control schemes; player is controlled by the keyboard but the line is drawn with the mouse

## What worked

The line drawing mechanic was great. People were first surprised (pleasantly) by it.
Mechanic teaching was great, players caught on it easily and solved challenges without issues.

## What didnâ€™t work

First 2/3 levels were a bit long.

Lots of bugs and inconsistencies when switching between worlds, especially when switching in the middle of a block.

Player walk was too slow.

Lack of variety in the puzzles: the mechanic itself was not enough to power through a lot
more than 3-5 levels
